Needed fixes and feedback:
Allocate 2 words = 8 bytes, not 2 bytes
uintptr_t is 64 bits on 64 bit systems, so 8 bytes itself
pointer arithmetic is based off of the type of the pointer
pointer itself *should* be either 32 or 64 bits
	 depending on x32 vs x64 system usually
Should have used an offset to the next memory, 
rather than storing pointers inside the memory

if the input pointer already fits the requested length,
 then just return the pointer you were given since it's already big enough
If hrealloc calls null then just call hmalloc
